         <h4>Open Science Framework (OSF)</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://openscienceframework.org/">OSF</a> supports the scientific workflow.  Create projects and use them to organize and archive research materials and data.  Share those materials with just collaborators, or make them available publicly.  Get credit for making materials available when others view, download, use, or extend them.  Register projects to create frozen versions to mark the state of a project at a particular point in its history - onset of data collection, at manuscript submission, final version for publication. OSF is part network of research materials, part version control system, and part collaboration software.</p>

        <h4>Open Science Collaboration</h4>
        <p>The <a href="http://openscienceframework.org/project/VMRGu/wiki/home">Open Science Collaboration</a> is an interdisciplinary group of individuals operating through the Open Science Framework. The OSC advances projects in open science guided by common interests and community standards. These collaborative, crowdsourced projects include the <a href="http://openscienceframework.org/project/EZcUj/wiki/home">Reproducibility Project</a> to estimate the reproducibility of psychological science, the <a href="http://archivalproject.org/">Archival Project</a> to evaluate current research practices as reported in published research, and Replication Value to generate metrics for evaluating which findings are worth replicating.</p>
         <p>Learn more or get involved at the Open Science Collaboration OSF page, visit the <a href="http://osc.centerforopenscience.org/">OSC blog</a>, or join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openscienceframework">Google Group</a> conversation.</p>
        <h4>Grants</h4>
        <p>The Reproducibility Project <a href="http://openscienceframework.org/project/EZcUj/node/KqgT5/wiki/home">offers grants</a> to conduct replications for its effort to estimate the reproducibility of Psychological Science. The application process is easy. Contribute to the community effort, and get a grant to do it!</p>

        <p>COS occasionally invites grant proposals to increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. Proposals can aim to (1) create or connect open science infrastructure, (2) enable or incentivize new practices by scientists, societies, journals, funders, libraries, or other stakeholders in science, or (3) conduct metascience research with implications for improving scientific practices.
Project proposals are solutions-oriented. COS does not fund meetings to write more academic papers suggesting that someone should do something. COS funds the projects by the someone that does the something. <a href="/grants">Find out more</a>.</p>
