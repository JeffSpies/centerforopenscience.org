<h3>Partnerships, Collaborations, and Funding</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Background</dt><dd><p>The Center for Open Science (COS) builds and maintains open technologies that improve the scientific workflow for researchers, journals, libraries, and other stakeholders in science. Through its Open Science Framework, COS aims to collaborate and connect technologies by service providers across the scientific workflow from data repositories to lab notebooks to analysis and visualization tools to manuscript and grant preparation tools to mechanisms for curation, archiving, search and discovery of the scientific literature. With its unique open, non-profit model, COS does not have competitors and does not derive revenue from its services. Rather, COS is funded by foundations with an aim of providing core, free infrastructure to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of scientific research. </p></dd>
    <dt>Responsibilities</dt><dd><p>Developing and maintaining collaborations and partnerships with groups and organizations providing services for the scientific workflow. This includes technology companies, scientific organizations and societies, and knowledge management organizations - universities, libraries, and publishers. Collaboration with the software development team on development and integration of services to support the scientific workflow that support the needs of stakeholders in the scientific process. Maintaining relationships with funding bodies. Hosting visiting teams and individuals for development of collaborative relationships. Developing relationships and sharing services with scientific societies, funders, and other stakeholders in the scientific process. Gift and grant development and grant writing. Some public communication about COS goals and activities. Some representation of COS at meetings of developers, tech groups, scientific societies, and funders in the U.S. and possibly around the world. Working with leadership team on communications and strategy.</p></dd>
    <dt>Skills</dt><dd><p>Extremely high social, communication, and presentation skills; knowledge and comfort with strategic communication with technology, science, and knowledge management organizations (e.g., publishers, libraries); very strong writing skills, particularly grant writing; team-oriented; very strong work ethic; ability to use web communication and documentation software effectively; multi-tasking; self-starter and industrious; adaptivity to rapidly changing demands in a high performance workplace; willingness to travel. Programming/developer skills or exposure a plus.</p></dd>
    <dt>Notes</dt><dd><p>The Center for Open Science is an equal opportunity employer and strongly encourages applications from members of groups underrepresented in science and technology industries. The Center for Open Science (COS) is a non-profit organization based in Charlottesville, Virginia dedicated to increasing openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. Operating with an technology start-up atmosphere and mindset, the COS team moves quickly, identifies problems and creates solutions, encourages risk-taking, blends science and technology, is highly collaborative, is high energy, and is dedicated to openness.</p>
    <p>COS has three primary activities: (1) infrastructure development to support the scientific workflow (<a href="http://openscienceframework.org/">http://openscienceframework.org</a>) - documentation, archiving, sharing, and registration - and connect with other open technologies, (2) community building among open-source developers, open science researchers, and the broader scientific community, and (3) metascience, research on scientific practices. COS is supported by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
