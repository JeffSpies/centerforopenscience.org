    <dt>Background</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This position is not with the Center for Open Science, but is, instead, a courtesy posting for the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in Social Sciences.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://bitss.org/">Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in Social Sciences</a> (BITSS) is a new effort to promote the integrity, replicability, and validity of empirical social science research. The program is fostering an active network of social science researchers and institutions committed to strengthening transparency in economics, political science, behavioral science, and related disciplines. Central to BITSS is the identification and evaluation of strategies or tools to improve research transparency, including study registries, pre-analysis plans, data archiving and sharing platforms, and replications.</p>
            <p>Headquartered at the <a href="http://cega.berkeley.edu">Center for Effective Global Action</a> at UC Berkeley, BITSS is looking for a Program Associate to support the initiativeâ€™s evaluation and outreach efforts. The candidate is expected to engage actively with social science researchers at scientific conferences, to raise awareness of new and emerging tools for research transparency. This could include the organization of satellite sessions, trainings, seminars, or other activities to share information and resources.</p>
            <p>The candidate also will contribute directly to the refinement of the Open Science Framework, a platform created by the Center for Open Science at the University of Virginia that helps researchers document and archive their study designs, materials and data. Toward this end, the candidate is expected to make several visits to the Center over the course of a year.</p>
