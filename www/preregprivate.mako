                                    A core principle of the scientific method is that our knowledge about how the universe works should grow more complete and accurate over time. Confronting this idealistic vision are forces that motivate our more mundane reality: writing publications and grants that are compelling, convincing our peers that our ideas are accurate and worth supporting, and simply succeeding in our careers. These incentives lead to practices that are misaligned with our values and science that cannot be reproduced. <i>In order to improve from the status quo, we need a process that accounts for these pressures.</i>
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Preregistration</h3>
                                      <p>Preregistration is a tool that helps us to be more transparent about our research practices. It is a timestamped, read-only copy of a plan that describes a studyâ€™s protocol and its analysis that guides a scientist to conduct research exactly as specified. It allows us to clearly present the results of hypothesis testing, confirmatory analyses while still allowing us show hypothesis generating, exploratory results as valuable insights that warrant further investigation.</p>

                                      <h3>The Preregistration Challenge</h3>
                                      <p>We have $1 million to give away in order to encourage this practice. We are awarding $1,000 each to 1,000 researchers who publish an article in an eligible journal that reports on an analysis preregistered on the OSF. Please review the information on this site to learn how you could be one of them! As with any competition, certain <a href="https://osf.io/4uxbj/" target="_blank">terms and conditions</a> apply, but please review our FAQ and ask us (prereg@cos.io) if you have questions!</p>

However, this increases the likelihood of committing a Type I error. Sample sizes that are predetermined before data collection, even if they are arbitrary or constrained by resources, avoid this bias.</p>

                                              Yes and no. You are obligated to conduct and report the exact tests that you specified. However, everyone knows that many novel discoveries are sometimes completely unanticipated. The goal of preregistration is not to stop researchers from conducting any 'exploratory' analyses, it simply makes clear which results were the outcome of planned analyses and which were not (<a href="http://orca.cf.ac.uk/59475/" target="_blank">Chambers et. al, 2014</a>).

Making the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analysis more transparent allows the reader to fairly evaluate the evidence being presented (<a href="http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/632.abstract" target="_blank">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</a>).

                                                Perhaps. Standards for preregistering studies and analysis plans using existing data do not yet exist.

                                                <p>When you submit your research plan, you will be asked to classify your use of existing data in your planned analysis. If necessary, you will be asked to describe the steps you are going to take to ensure that any existing data does not influence the analytical decisions. This description will be reviewed in our review process (see tab on left). Below are the possible categories that may be used:
                                                <ol type="I">
                                                <li><strong>Registration prior to collection of data:</strong> As of the date of submission of Research Plan for Preregistration, the data have not yet been realized, collected, or created. In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that the data do not exist to retain eligibility.
                                                </li>
                                                <li><strong>Registration prior to any human observation of the data: </strong>As of the date of submission, the data exist but have not yet been quantified, constructed, observed, or reported by anyone - including individuals that are not associated with the proposed Study and Research Plan. Examples include museum specimens that have not been measured, or data that have been collected by non-human collectors and are inaccessible.  In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that the data have not been observed by anyone and how this is the case to retain eligibility.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Registration prior to Entrant access to the data: </strong>As of the date of submission, the data exist, and have not been accessed by the Entrant, or the Entrantâ€™s Study collaborators. Commonly, this includes data that has been collected by another researcher or institution.  In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that they have not accessed the data, explain who has accessed the data, and justify how any observation, analysis, and reporting of that data avoids compromising the confirmatory nature of the Research Plan. The justification will be reviewed to determine eligibility.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Registration prior to Entrant analysis of the data: </strong>As of the date of submission, the data exist and have been accessed by the researcher, though no analysis has been conducted related to the Research Plan. Common situations for this are the existence of a large dataset that is the subject of many studies over time, or a split sample in which a portion is not analyzed to be subjected to confirmatory testing after exploratory analysis of the other data. In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that they have not analyzed the data related to the Research Plan (including calculation of summary statistics), explain what other analysis or reporting of the data has been done by the Entrant or others, and justify how any prior observation, analysis, and reporting of that data avoid compromising the confirmatory nature of the Research Plan.</li>

                                                    There are several circumstances that present specific challenges to the preregistration model.</p>

                                                    <li><strong>Studies in which you are not testing the significance of a specific null hypothesis.</strong> Preregistration can best reduce bias when the researcher intends to test collected data against a null hypothesis. There are many publishable, peer-reviewed endeavors in which this is not the case.
                                                    <li><strong>Hypothesis testing using pre-existing data.</strong> Using previously-collected data places additional burden on the researcher to demonstrate that no biases have influenced their decision making process. Seeing descriptive statistics prior to analysis inevitably affect analysis decisions. See above.
                                                    <li><strong>Field studies.</strong> Field science can be particularly challenging, with many variables outside of a researcher's control that affect the ability to collect data. Pilot trials, feedback from peers, and additional time or imagination in the planning phase can help to make your registered plans more accurate.
                                                  </ul>

                                                       Registered Reports are a particular publication format in which both the preregistered plans and the final manuscript undergo peer review. In the first stage, reviewers and editors evaluate the relevance of the research questions and the proposed methods to answer them. Submissions that pass stage one review are offered â€˜in principle acceptanceâ€™ (IPA), and the results are guaranteed to be published regardless of findings, as long as the methodology is carried out as described. Stage two peer review evaluates the complete manuscript before publication. </p> <p>In most cases, the Preregistration Challenge is not part of a Registered Report.

                                                            <li><strong>Possible response</strong> The results of these tests are included because they stem from prespecified analyses. Removing these results because of their non-significance would help perpetuate the publication bias already present in the literature. If the reviewer/editor proposes a reason why they believe the null result could be explained by a design flaw, it can often be helpful/appropriate to leave the test in, but discuss the reviewers concerns about the validity of that particular test/design feature in a discussion section.

However, every decision included in the preregistration process is one that a researcher will have to make at some point anyway, and making these decisions up front, before data collection begins, can improve your workflow and reduce subtle biases. Our goal is to create a system that is transparent and easy to use, and we welcome feedback (prereg@cos.io).

We also know that many publishable results are often not able to be reproduced. Therefore, we have created this incentive for researchers to try a new method. Our success will be measured by the number of award recipients who return to the process and register another analysis plan in the future (without being paid to do so!) because they have found it to improve their workflow and the reliability of their findings.

There are both strong theoretical reasons to preregister (<a href="http://orca.cf.ac.uk/59475/" target="_blank">Chambers et. al, 2014</a>; <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359" target="_blank">Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011</a>), and some empirical evidence that supports its effectiveness (<0a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382" target="_blank">Kaplan and Irvin, 2015</a>). We hope that the Preregistration Challenge will encourage researchers to give preregistration a try. During the prize period we will be conducting a parallel metascience project to evaluate the influence of preregistration on researchers' behaviors and the reproducibility of their studies. We would be delighted if you would consider participating by providing feedback on the preregistration process.

However, eventually all preregistrations will become public. It is possible to withdraw your preregistration, but a notification of retraction will be public. Finally, all submissions to the Preregistration Challenge will be reviewed by COS staff and designated external reviewers to assess its eligibility for the prize.

We suggest that you define a 'decision-tree' containing logical IF-THEN rules that specify the analyses that will be used in specific situations. We have put together <a href="https://osf.io/x5w7h/files/" target="_blank">some example decision trees</a> to give you some ideas of how to accomplish this. In the event that you need to conduct an unplanned analysis, please note that preregistration does not prevent you from doing so, it simply makes clear which analyses were planned and which were not.

                                            <ol>
                                            <li><h2>Research Plan Review</h2>
                                            <p>In order to be eligible for the Preregistration Challenge, each submission must pass a review process in which the statistical methods of the proposed study and its analyses are checked for completeness. <strong>This process does not assess the validity of the research question or statistical methodology and in no way affects the editorial decisions of any journal. This is not peer review.</strong>
                                            <p>We will review the submitted study design and analysis descriptions, and determine whether all question fields were answered with enough detail to fully pre-specify the design and analysis plan. <a href="https://osf.io/h4ga8/" target="_blank">Here are the guidelines</a> that reviewers will use when evaluating your submitted plans.
                                            <p>Only studies that pass this review process are eligible for the Preregistration Challenge. You may of course register anything else on the Open Science Framework at any time, but plans that do not pass this review process will not be eligible for a $1,000 prize.

                                            <li><h2>Article Review</h2>
                                            <p>Rarely does a complex undertaking go exactly according to plan. Preregistration allows you to more easily distinguish between hypothesis testing analyses (the "confirmatory" analyses) and hypothesis generating, exploratory analyses. Accordingly, articles must be reviewed to verify that the plans were followed and new analyses were appropriately separated.</p>
                                            Below are examples of deviations from the preregistered plans and how a researcher could respond to them. </p>
                                            <ul>
                                            <li><p><strong>Deviations from Sampling Plan.</strong> </p>
                                            An author may not be able to recruit a sufficient number of participants to reach 95% power, but ended up with just over 80% power. In this case, the author should explain how their efforts were exhaustive and not influenced by the data collected up to that point.</p>
                                            <li><p><strong>Deviations from Design Plan</p></strong>
                                            Partway through data collection, a researcher notices that lichens with more sun exposure tend to show the phenotype that was expected only during a certain time of day. The researcher should either preregister a new plan with "sun exposure" as a predictor variable or include that new variable under "exploratory" results.</p>
                                            <li><p><strong>Deviations from Analysis Plan</p></strong>
                                            An author noticed that by controlling for one particular variable (e.g. the age of the subjects, the number of offspring a fish had, or the size of the local economy) the expected relationship became statistically significant. Since this was not predicted from the beginning (even if makes perfect sense in hindsight!) this would have to be clearly labeled as exploratory analysis. If the author wanted to keep it as confirmatory results, the analysis could be rerun with this control on a new set of data, or part of the data that had been kept aside from the beginning, but that analysis would also have to be preregistered in order to be eligible for the prize.</p>
