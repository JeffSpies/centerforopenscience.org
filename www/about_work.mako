                <h1><strong>Our Work<br><br></strong></h1>
                <p>The Center for Open Science was founded in the spring of 2013. We began with one project, the
                    <a href="https://osf.io/">Open Science Framework</a>, and a mission: to use open practices to
                    improve scientific research. Since then, our founders, Brian Nosek and Jeff Spies, have turned that mission into a daily goal. At COS, we
                    believe that by increasing transparency, we can improve practices and results in all scientific disciplines.</p>

                <h3 class="center margin-top-50 margin-bottom-20">We engage in three primary activities:</h3>

                                The OSF provides version control, altmetrics for measuring impact, and personalizable privacy options.</dd>

                                new community standards and encourage more crosstalk between scientists. We are part of the

                                        the rate of replication and reproducibility in psychology. Over 150 researchers from around the globe are involved in the RP:P, conducting research, extracting data from existing articles, and providing administrative and technical support.

                                        Students learn how to dissect a scientific article by extracting the most important data from a pool of published articles. They record information like power, confidence intervals, and whether or not the study was a replication of a previous publication.
                                        At the close of this project, we hope to draw conclusions about the current state of scientific practices in psychology.
