                <p>27 October 2015| Charlottesville, VA and Boulder, CO</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Center for Open Science (COS) and the Foundation for Earth Science (FES) are pleased to announce a multi-year partnership to support greater access to Earth and environmental science data. The partnership marries FES’s domain expertise in Earth science with COS’s technical infrastructure to support the data sharing and research needs of the Earth science community.</a>
</p>
<br>
                <p>
                    The partnership will see the intersection of core projects for each group. The FES-supported Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation) Testbed is a forum for innovative collaborations where technologies, protocols, and best practices in research can be explored and evaluated. COS’s flagship infrastructure product, the Open Science Framework (OSF), is a free, secure web application designed to support researchers’ workflow through project management, sharing, and archiving with the goal of making scientific research more transparent. COS and FES will work together to integrate OSF with ESIP Testbed projects, enhancing project organization, transparency and documentation. In turn, FES will provide feedback and guidance to help COS tailor the OSF to the needs of the Earth science community. COS will also support the Technology Evaluation Framework (TEF), a project developed by ESIP within the OSF for coordinating independent testing of technology projects within the Earth science community. </p>

                    <br><p>Improved discoverability and access to the research presented at the biannual ESIP Federation meetings is another goal of this partnership. COS’s free presentation sharing service, OSF for Meetings, will be used to store and share the posters and presentations given at future ESIP Federation meetings, enhancing discoverability and impact of the work. COS and FES will also work together to integrate past conference materials onto the same platform to create a rich set of materials. </p>

                     <br><p>Together, COS and FES will identify additional collaborative opportunities to support Earth science community initiatives and greater access to Earth science research.</p>

                     <br><p>Brian Nosek, Executive Director of the Center for Open Science, noted, “FES’s goals to advance Earth science information through open, transparent practices align well with COS’s mission to improve the transparency, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. We’re happy to be able to support the Earth science community by developing tools to foster project organization, collaboration, and data sharing.”</p>

                     <br><p>“We are delighted to partner with COS and provide the communities we support with more advanced collaboration and data management opportunities. This is also a fantastic opportunity to collectively promote transparency and openness in science,” added Erin Robinson, Executive Director of FES.</p>
