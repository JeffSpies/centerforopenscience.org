                <p>26 January 2016 | Charlottesville, VA and South Bend, IN</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Center for Open Science (COS) is pleased to announce a multi-year partnership with the University of Notre Dame to support long-term solutions for open science by integrating Notre Dame services with COS’s free, open source web application, the Open Science Framework (OSF). The partnership serves as a model for community-driven development of the OSF to support the needs of researchers within the institutional environment.  The collaboration combines the expertise of a major, technologically-advanced research university with the agility of a mission-driven, independent, non-profit tech company.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                The Open Science Framework is a free, scholarly commons that increases efficiency of research by organizing the entire research lifecycle in one location. Simplified project management tools such as automated versioning, fine-grained privacy controls, connections to other applications, and bibliographic citations that include persistent identifiers make conducting and sharing research seamless.  To begin, Notre Dame’s Center for Research Computing (ND CRC) and Hesburgh Libraries will contribute extensive expertise in high performance computing, cyberinfrastructure development, research software development, data management, semantics, and metadata. Notre Dame is a major partner in several open science initiatives including the National Data Service (NDS), a community driven effort to simplify finding, using, and publishing data; NSF-funded Data and Software Preservation for Open Science (DASPOS), a collaborative effort to explore preservation techniques for high energy physics datasets, software, and architecture; and the Vector-Borne Disease Network (VecNet), a repository for modeling the impacts of interventions on malaria transmission and control.</p>

                <br>As part of the partnership, Notre Dame will also integrate its institutional repository, CurateND, with the OSF while performing an audit of OSF features against project management needs of the University. This will enable researchers to archive their research data directly into CurateND from the active research environment. Further, both groups will test the registration of the VecNet digital library of malaria data files on OSF, use the OSF as the interface for the backend dashboard developed for the NDS, and work on a reproducible software engineering environment by creating and documenting a development environment for the OSF. Notre Dame will connect these initiatives with the OSF, providing users with a more seamless workflow experience.</p>

                <br><p>This partnership lays the foundation for the integration of OSF at a local, institutional level. Institutional branding and central authentication on the OSF will foster ease of use and trust amongst university researchers. Integrating the OSF with institutional repositories will promote long-term preservation of data and sharing with research collaborators. Enhanced functionality for metadata description on the OSF will help increase discoverability of research and support institutional data preservation workflows.</p>

                <br><p>Andrew Sallans, COS Partnerships, Collaborations, and Funding Manager states, “This partnership highlights how aligned the Center for Open Science and Notre Dame are in increasing transparency in scientific research. OSF for Institutions is a big step for COS in refining the Open Science Framework in ways that add value for institutions, and we found a wonderful development partner for this effort.  Through integrated authentication and institutional branding, OSF for Institutions will help the University highlight the breadth of research being conducted there, allow for easier curation of data, and showcase the impact of research outputs.”</p>

                <br><p>“We are thrilled to engage in this new partnership with the Center for Open Science. Not only do our research missions align, but being able to contribute our resources to support open, reliable, and reproducible science will help propel scientific research into an uninhibited realm in the future,” says Jarek Nabrzyski, Director of the Center for Research Computing.</p>

                <br><p>"In keeping with our mission, the Hesburgh Libraries are committed to help manage, preserve, curate, and globally share the research and associated data created at Notre Dame. This exciting, forward-thinking partnership with the Center for Open Science will lead the way for streamlining this process, meeting data sharing mandates, and increasing opportunities for impact for all researchers around the world,” says Edward H. Arnold University Librarian Diane Parr Walker.</p>
