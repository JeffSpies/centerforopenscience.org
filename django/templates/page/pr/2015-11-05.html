                <br>
                <p>The Center for Open Science (COS) is pleased to announce that it has partnered with Time-Sharing for the Social Sciences (TESS), an organization that funds research and performs data collection, to use COS’s free web platform, the Open Science Framework (OSF), for hosting publicly archived TESS research studies.</a>
</p>
<br>
                <p>
                    TESS uses online technology to conduct general population experiments on behalf of investigators throughout the social sciences using a large, diverse population of participants.  The data and materials are housed in an online platform and made publicly available for those interested in learning more about social science research. The non-profit science and technology organization, <a href="http://cos.io">Center for Open Science</a> develops and maintains the <a href="http://osf.io">Open Science Framework</a> (OSF), which supports scientific workflow from project and data management through data archiving and sharing. TESS will utilize COS’s technical expertise and infrastructure to produce an automated, integrated workflow using the OSF for new TESS proposals and data collection, along with providing an archival space to house past datasets and materials. The collaboration between TESS and COS will allow both groups to broaden their missions of increasing transparency and visibility of research in the social sciences.  </p>

                    <br><p>Andrew Sallans, COS Partnerships, Collaborations, and Funding Manager notes,  “Our collaboration with TESS will help further expand research transparency, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research in the social sciences. We are happy to support TESS and the community by housing their data on our platform, the Open Science Framework.”</p>

                     <br><p>“We are thrilled to partner with COS – not only will it ensure that TESS data, going back to 2003, will have a permanent, archived home but it also will facilitate the secondary usage of the hundreds of survey experiments conducted by TESS,” says Dr. James Druckman, Principal Investigator for TESS. </p>

                <p>The <a href="http://cos.io">Center for Open Science</a> (COS) is a non-profit technology startup founded in 2013 with a mission to increase openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. COS pursues this mission by building communities around open science practices, supporting metascience research, and developing and maintaining free, open source software tools. The<a href="http://osf.io"> Open Science Framework</a> (OSF), COS’s flagship product, is a web application that connects and supports the research workflow, enabling scientists to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their research. Researchers use the OSF to collaborate, document, archive, share, and register research projects, materials, and data.

                <br><h4><strong>About Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences</strong></h4>
                <p>Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) program (<a href="http://tessexperiments.org/">http://tessexperiments.org/</a>) is a National Science Foundation supported project that invites social scientists to submit proposals to implement population-based experiments. Proposals undergo peer-review and are fielded on a competitive basis. TESS offers graduate students and faculty the opportunity to field population-based experiments at no cost to the investigators themselves.
