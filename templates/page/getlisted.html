            <h2><strong>Journal eligibility for the <a href="/prereg">Preregistration Challenge</a></strong></h2>
            <p>One thousand researchers will <a href="/prereg">win $1,000</a> each for publishing the results of preregistered research in an eligible journal. Authors conduct the preregistration and meet eligibility criteria independently of the journal and journal review process.  There is no additional work for journal staff.  However, to receive a prize, authors must publish in an <a href="/preregjournals" target="_blank">eligible journal</a>, as determined by the prize administrators at the Center for Open Science.  Eligible journals demonstrate commitments to open, transparent science and maintain rigorous peer review processes for publication.</p>

            <p><h2><strong>Criteria for becoming an eligible journal</strong></h2></p>

                <p>Journals must demonstrate commitment to research transparency by doing at least one of the following:
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>Becoming a signatory to the <a href="/top" target="_blank">Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines</a>, which commits the journal to conducting a review of the guidelines for potential adoption within one year.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Surfacing transparent research practices by <a href="https://osf.io/tvyxz/wiki/home/" target="_blank">issuing Badges</a> in publications. </li>
                    <li><p>Adopting the <a href="https://osf.io/8mpji/wiki/home/" target="_blank">Registered Reports</a> publication format as a submission option for authors.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <p>Furthermore, though the Center for Open Science strongly values new initiatives emphasizing post-publication peer review, administration of the prize relies on domain expert evaluation of the scientific merits of the preregistered research through peer review prior to publication.  Otherwise, gaming of the prize would be trivial.  As such, <a href="/preregjournals" target="_blank">eligible journals</a> conduct rigorous, pre-publication peer review and transparently demonstrate adherence to pre-publication peer review.  Journals that conduct exclusively post-publication peer review are welcome and encouraged to discuss with prize administrators how their peer review process could be used to determine prize eligibility. Journals that do not maintain strong standards in peer review for publication will not be made eligible journals.</p>
