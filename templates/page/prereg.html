                                    <p>
                                        Core values of science are showing your work (transparency) and independent replication (reproducibility). However, scientists must publish, and publishing success is more likely with innovative, positive, and tidy results, even at the expense of transparent, reproducible research. What is good for science and what is good for scientists are not always be the same.  This creates a conflict-of-interest that could result in researchers inadvertently employing a variety of cognitive biases that lower the reproducibility of observed results. For example, a researcher may recall the original study purpose and analysis plan differently after observing the results, and unintentionally bias conclusions toward results that look good for publication and ignore results that do not. The potential impact is a published literature that is more beautiful, and less reproducible, than reality.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Preregistration</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Preregistration distinguishes confirmatory (hypothesis testing) and exploratory (hypothesis generating) analyses.  Confirmatory analyses are determined in advance; Exploratory analyses are responsive to what is observed in the data.  Confirmatory analyses maximize diagnostic value of statistical inferences; Exploratory analyses provide opportunity for discovery of unexpected outcomes.  Both are important for scientific discovery.  The same data cannot be used to both generate and test a hypothesis. With preregistration, confirmatory analyses are planned in advance in order to retain the validity of their statistical inferences, and exploratory analyses are reported as post hoc investigations that might inspire confirmatory tests in future studies.
                                    </p>

                                        Preregistration is an unfamiliar practice in many areas of science. We will give 1,000 awards of $1,000 each to promote education and experience with preregistration.  Award winners will have completed a preregistration using the Open Science Framework, a free scholarly commons,  and published the results in an eligible journal.

                                                    <p>No. Confirmatory analyses are planned in advance, but they can be conditional. A pre-analysis plan might specify preconditions for certain analysis strategies and what alternative analysis will be performed if those conditions are not met.  For example, if an analysis strategy requires data for a variable to be normally distributed, the analysis plan can specify evaluating normality and an alternate non-parametric test to be conducted if the normality assumption is violated.</p>
                                                    <p>For conditional analyses, we suggest that you define a 'decision-tree' containing logical IF-THEN rules that specify the analyses that will be used in specific situations. <a href="https://osf.io/x5w7h/files/" target="_blank">Here are some example decision trees</a>. In the event that you need to conduct an unplanned analysis, preregistration does not prevent you from doing so.  Preregistration simply makes clear which analyses were planned and which were not.</p>

For example, imagine that you planned 100 tests in your preregistration, and then reported all 100, 5 of which achieved p < .05.  It is possible (even likely) that those five significant results are false positives.  If the paper then discussed just those five and ignored the others, the interpretation could be highly misleading.  Planning in advance is necessary but not sufficient for preserving diagnosticity.</p>
                                                    <p>To reduce interpretation biases, confirmatory research designs often have a small number of tests focused on the key questions in the research design, or adjustments for multiple-tests are included in the analysis plan.  It may be that some preregistered analyses are dismissed as inappropriate or ill-conceived in retrospect, but doing that explicitly and transparently assists the reader in evaluating the rest of the confirmatory results.</p>

Exploratory analysis is very important for discovery and hypothesis generation.  Simultaneously, results from exploratory analyses are more tentative, p-values are less diagnostic, and additional data is required to subject an exploratory result to a confirmatory test.  Making the distinction between exploratory and confirmatory analysis more transparent increases credibility of reports and helps the reader to fairly evaluate the evidence presented (<a href="http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/632.abstract" target="_blank">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</a>).</p>

In exploratory work, the researcher is looking for potential relationships within a dataset, effects of a candidate drug, or differences between two groups. The researcher wants to minimize the chance of making a Type II error, or a false negative, because finding something new and unexpected could be an important new discovery.</p>

A goal of pre-analysis plans is to avoid analysis decisions that are contingent on observed results (except when those contingencies are specified in advance, see above).  This is more challenging for existing data, particularly when outcomes of the data have been observed or reported.  Standards for effective preregistration using existing data do not yet exist. We are using the Preregistration Challenge to help develop such standards.  As such, we have defined initial eligibility standards with pre-existing data and expect these to be refined over time.</p>

Examples include museum specimens that have not been measured, or data that have been collected by non-human collectors and are inaccessible. In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that the data have not been observed by anyone and how this is the case to retain eligibility.

In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that they have not accessed the data, explain who has accessed the data, and justify how any observation, analysis, and reporting of that data avoids compromising the confirmatory nature of the Research Plan.

Common situations for this are the existence of a large dataset that is the subject of many studies over time, or a split sample in which a portion is not analyzed to be subjected to confirmatory testing after exploratory analysis of the other data. In this scenario, the Entrant must certify that they have not analyzed the data related to the Research Plan (including calculation of summary statistics), explain what other analysis or reporting of the data has been done by the Entrant or others, and justify how any prior observation, analysis, and reporting of that data avoid compromising the confirmatory nature of the Research Plan.

                                                    <p>There are several research circumstances that present challenges to conducting preregistered research.

There are many publishable, peer-reviewed endeavors for which this is not the case such as qualitative research and some kinds of observational studies.</li>
                                                            <li><strong>Hypothesis testing using pre-existing data.</strong> Using previously-collected data places additional burden on the researcher to avoid analysis decisions that are contingent on the data and research outcomes. For example, seeing a simple summary of descriptive statistics prior to inferential testing can influence the choice of test and comparison of conditions or variables.</li>
                                                            <li><strong>Field studies.</strong> Field science can be particularly challenging to preregister. Sample size, measured variables, and even design may have to respond to unpredictable events. Pilot trials, feedback from peers, and additional time or imagination in the planning phase can help make registered plans more accurate, including identification of data collection contingencies in advance.</li>

However, in the case of Registered Reports, that review is about the substance of the research and is overseen by journal editors. Research designs that pass peer review are offered ‘in principle acceptance’ (IPA) ensuring that the results are guaranteed to be published regardless of findings, as long as the methodology is carried out as described. Registered Reports are currently offered at 23 journals.</p>
                                                    <p>Participants in the Prereg Challenge are welcome and encouraged to submit their preregistered designs to the Registered Reports mechanism at their preferred journal.  We recommend undergoing peer review at the journal first and preregistering for the Prereg Challenge after obtaining in-principle acceptance.  That way, the registered Prereg Challenge will not need to be revised following substantive peer review at the journal.</p>

                                                    <hr>
                                                    <p><strong>Possible editorial feedback:</strong> Reviewers or editors may request that you remove an experiment, study, analysis, variable, or design feature because the results are null results or marginal.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Prereg requirement:</strong> All preregistered analysis plans must be reported. Selective reporting undermines the diagnosticity of reported statistical inferences.
                                                    <p><strong>Possible response to the editor:</strong> The results of these tests are included because they stem from prespecified analyses in order to conduct a confirmatory test. Removing these results because of their non-significance would perpetuate publication bias already present in the literature (<a href="http://orca.cf.ac.uk/59475/" target="_blank">Chambers et al., 2014</a>; <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359" target="_blank">Simmons et al., 2011</a>; <a href="http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/632" target="_blank">Wagenmakers et al., 2012</a>).</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> If the reviewer/editor proposes a reason why they believe the null result could be explained by a design flaw, it can often be helpful/appropriate to leave the test in, but discuss the reviewers concerns about the validity of that particular test/design feature in a discussion section.</p>
                                                    <hr>
                                                    <p><strong>Possible editorial feedback:</strong> Why are you referring to a preregistered plan and reporting them separately from other analyses?</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Prereg requirement:</strong> The published article must make clear which analyses were part of the confirmatory design (usually distinguished in the results section with confirmatory and exploratory results sections), and there must be a URL to the preregistration on the OSF.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Possible response to the editor:</strong> The registration was certified prior to the start of data analysis.  This defines analyses that were prespecified and confirmatory versus those which were not prespecified and therefore exploratory. Clarifying this allows readers to see that the hypotheses, analyses, and design that were prespecified have been accurately and fully reported (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3893289" target="_blank">Jaeger & Halliday, 1998</a>; <a  href="http://psr.sagepub.com/content/2/3/196" target="_blank">Kerr, 1998</a>, <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1352120" target="_blank">Thomas & Peterson, 2012</a>).</p>

                                                    <p><strong>Prereg requirement:</strong> Additional tests are fine, they just need to be distinguished clearly from the confirmatory tests.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>Possible response to the editor:</strong>  Yes, these additional analyses are informative.  We made sure to distinguish them from our preregistered analysis plan, which is the most resistant to the problem of alpha inflation.  These analyses provide additional information for learning from our data.</p>

                                                    Preparing these plans does require time and effort. However, every decision included in the preregistration process is one that a researcher will have to make at some point anyway, and making these decisions up front, before data collection begins, can improve your workflow and reduce subtle biases. Our goal is to create a system that is transparent and easy to use, and ultimately increases the efficiency and effectiveness of research design.  We welcome feedback (prereg@cos.io) about how to make it even better.

Also, evidence suggests that publishable results are often not easily reproduced (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html" target="_blank">Begley & Ellis, 2012</a>; <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716" target="_blank">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</a>; <a href="http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd3439-c1" target="_blank">Prinz et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we have created this incentive for researchers to try preregistration as a formalization of the idealized model of confirmatory hypothesis testing. An indicator of success will be measured by the number of participants who register analysis plans after participating in the Prereg Challenge because they have found it to improve their workflow and their confidence in their findings.

There are both strong theoretical reasons to preregister (<a href="http://orca.cf.ac.uk/59475/" target="_blank">Chambers et. al, 2014</a>; <a href="http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/1864-9335/a000192" target="_blank">Nosek & Lakens, 2014</a>; <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.1177/0956797611417632" target="_blank">Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011</a>; <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1352120" target="_blank">Thomas & Peterson, 2012</a>), and some empirical evidence that suggests that it does impact research outcomes (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132382" target="_blank">Kaplan and Irvin, 2015</a>). We are conducting the Preregistration Challenge to increase experience and evidence about preregistration in the basic sciences.

All registrations eventually become public because that is part of the purpose of a registry - to reduce the file-drawer effect (sometimes called the grey literature). It is possible to withdraw your preregistration, but a notification of the withdrawal will be public.

This review has no impact on the independent editorial decisions of any journal.</strong></p>
                                                    <p>Prereg Challenge administrators and reviewers will review the submitted study design and analysis descriptions, and determine whether all question fields were answered with enough detail to fully pre-specify the design and analysis plan, and follow the eligibility requirements.  <a href="https://osf.io/h4ga8/" target="_blank">Here are the guidelines</a> that reviewers will use when evaluating your submitted plans.</p>

Sometimes these deviations will render the preregistration ineligible for the Prereg Challenge award.  Other times, these deviations will not affect the diagnosticity of statistical inference and remain eligible for the award.  In either case, deviations from preregistered plans must be documented explicitly in the article.</p>
